This is not a script like the others. This is quick instrustions on
some addition things you may want to add but aren't mandatory.

udisk2 with udiskie is installed, enable by adding to i3 config 

exec_always udisk2
exec_always udiskie

For lightdm, I would suggest adding 

theme-name = Arc-Dark
icon-theme-name = Papirus-Dark
background = #2f343f

This changes the theme to dark, uses the papirus icons and changes the background to a grey
Add these in their corresponding spots under [greeter]

These scripts use i3status for the bar. I would suggest bumblebee-status from the aur.
Installed by running

paru -S bumblebee-status
or 
yay -S bumblebee-status

If you want to use rofi. Install via pacman -S and uncomment the rofi part in i3 config

Would suggest autotiling
Installed by running 

paru -S autotiling
or
yay -S autotiling
