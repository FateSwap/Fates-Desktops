# Fates-Desktops
These are setup scripts for different dektops. It should have all the basics to get you up and running in what ever you choose.

PLEASE REMEMBER: Update the system before trying any of this

IMPORTANT: For any of the script pertaining to installing a program like paru
YOU NEED to chown the file and change the owner to your user or you will get 
directories you dont own. You can force delete with sudo and your file manager

Prerequisites: Just need an arch linux install or arch based distro with git

Install: just make a folder and git clone the repo. Use chmod +x on all the scripts you plan to use.
Then execute via ./Scriptname.sh

Notes: if Btop++ script fails try running with sudo. It did the trick for me.

For wallpapers I would suggest to git clone

https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers

https://github.com/FrenzyExists/wallpapers

Both is about 2000 or so wallpapers of all types
